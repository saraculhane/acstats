Most of statistics as well as aspects of machine learning rely on linear models or Gaussian distributions in order to successfully model and separate signal from noise.  While our focus throughout our coursework at Amherst has mostly been involved analysis based on known or applied variables and distributions,  Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and other methods of Blind Source Separation (BSS) call for the decomposition of their components with much more limited knowledge of their distribution than we have seen previously.  By identifying independent, non-Gaussian components of a mixture with ICA, the desired/original source can be uncovered and hidden information about the data can be revealed. R packages like fastICA,JADE and ICA Infomax make its application to numerous fields more efficient and usable.
